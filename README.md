# Predict features impacting Bike Rental Demand for Boom Bike company
This project aims to build a predictive model for the demand for shared bikes using the given dataset of independent variables. The primary goal is to help the management understand how various factors influence the demand for bike rentals and use this insight to refine their business strategies.

By analyzing the relationship between bike demand and the features (e.g., weather conditions, time of the year, working days, etc.), the management can:

Predict demand under varying conditions.
Optimize resource allocation (e.g., bike inventory, maintenance).
Develop targeted marketing campaigns and pricing strategies for high-demand periods.
Adapt to new market dynamics based on learned insights from the model.
This predictive model will act as a tool for decision-making and demand management, enabling the business to meet customer expectations and scale effectively in new markets.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Project Background:
Boom Bikes strategic team wants to know the factors impacting the bike rental demand so that they can design and decide on the bike supply, pricing and run any marketing campaigns etc for their rented bikes
- Business Problem
The primary business problem is to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors such as weather, seasonal trends, working days, and other relevant features. By accurately modeling bike demand, the management aims to:

Align supply with expected demand to minimize unavailability or surplus of bikes.
Optimize resource allocation, such as staff scheduling, bike maintenance, and fleet distribution.
Formulate strategies for pricing and promotions during high-demand or low-demand periods.
- Data set used : Historical bike rentals data fro year 2018 and 2019 as provided in day.csv



## Conclusions
- The trained model has R sq of 0.80 
- There are 15 impacting features to the model
- Working day, winter, Mondays and clear day have positive impact on the bike rentals. Where as wind speed and light precipitations and months - Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar and Nov have negative impact on the bike demand
